# Quiz Website Backend

Welcome to the Quiz Website Backend repository! This project serves as the backend server for the quiz website frontend. It provides APIs for managing quizzes, questions, and user interactions.

## Description

## Features

- RESTful APIs for CRUD operations on quizzes, questions, and user interactions.
- Authentication and authorization mechanisms for administrator.
- Database integration for storing quiz data, user responses, and analytics metrics.
- Integration with frontend to provide seamless user experiences.
